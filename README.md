Archeo is a package for inferring the natal kick and parental masses posterior of black holes in Pair-instability Supernova (PISN) gap.
We study the parental black holes of GW190521 and investigate the probability that the component black holes in GW190521 are a result of black hole merger.
The methodology is described in [Methodology](#methodology) section, and it can be applied to any other gravitational wave event.

We also deployed a web-based UI on streamlit for a preview of what do we study.
Please take a look if you are interested.
