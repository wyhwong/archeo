Archeo is a Python package designed to infer the natal kick, ancestral masses, and spins of black holes in the Pair-instability Supernova (PISN) gap,
with a particular focus on hierarchical black hole formation.
Please check out our [methodology](https://wyhwong.github.io/archeo/methodology/) if you are interested.
